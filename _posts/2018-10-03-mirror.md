The baby stirs. I stretch and roll out of bed. It’s time for me to give our two-month old a bottle and give my wife a much needed break.
            
I feed her with my eyes half open and let my mind wander. Sometimes, in the throes of sleep deprivation, it wanders too far, to corners of my mind I didn’t know existed–places I’m scared to discover my brain holds.
            
I look around the room and spot my reflection. In the darkness, and without my glasses, it is truly a shadow. For a moment I think it moves while I’m still. I blink hard. I sway and turn my head and watch myself in the mirror. I chuckle silently at my imagination and lay the baby in her bassinet. Time to go back to sleep.
            
As I walk back to my side of the bed, my reflection walks, too. I lie down. My reflection doesn’t. It stands, staring at me. Now I’m shaken from half-sleep to a sudden awareness that something is not right. I fumble for my glasses, plant them hard on my face and look back to the mirror. My reflection has vanished, but it dawns on me–this whole time I wasn’t looking at my mirror. It was my window, which is now wide open.
